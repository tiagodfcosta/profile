        content: `For 10 weeks I took part in the intensive programming Boot Camp of Bytes4Future. In this program I learned to write JavaScript (ES6) code, I also learned the basis of topics such as Object Oriented Programming, Data Structures, Algorithms, Functional Programming and Basic Software Principles.

        Starting from the HTML and CSS base acquired in the PowerUp stage of Bytes4Future, I learned to develop interfaces using the declarative model, more specifically, using React. I also learned what Redux is all about.
        
        I learned how to use JavaScript in the backend using NodeJS to run JavaScript code outside the browser. I developed REST APIs using Express and had my first chance to play with Web Sockets.
        
        To store application data, I learned how to use files, most of the time to store JSON objects. I also learned to work with MongoDB and learned the basics of SQL.
        
        During the development of projects I used Git and GitHub to manage source code versions.`,
